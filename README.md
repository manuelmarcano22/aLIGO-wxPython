# aLIGO-wxPython
Graphical User Interface for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis. 

For an specific compact binary system of the same mass and at a given distance it calculates the Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Horizon Distance. Average Range, time to innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), and time in View for three different detectors configuration (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston and a Network of the two detectors). Three design parameters can be change: 1-Total Suspension Length, 2- Section Suspension Length and 3-Total mass of the suspension. Can select from 9 different masses, and 3 lengths for the total and section. To source parameters can be changed: 1-Mass of the two binaries, 2-Distance of the binaries. It plots and calculate the amplitude spectral density (ASD) from the Seismic, Suspension Thermal, Coating Brownian and Quantum Noise.
